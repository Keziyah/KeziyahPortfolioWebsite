                    The power of language goes beyond words.
                    My colleagues and I created Spacechat, a virtual reality chatroom, in order
                    to explore the connections between language, data visualitzation, emotion, 
                    and virtual reality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Spacechat allows users to chatwith each other in real time by 
                    speaking through virtual words. What a user said is translated into 
                    their partner’s language, while the sentiment, personality, and emotional
                    analysis of the conversation is used to animate the scenes.             
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are many things happening at once during a Spacechat session: language is being translated and transmitted, speech is being processed for
                    sentiment and emotion, and this data is being used to control animation. All of this data is transmitted in real time with SocketIO. Redux and vanilla JavaScript are used to control text analysis based animations. We used GoogleTranslate for translation, and Indico for personality, emotion, and sentiment analysis. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Spacechat contains many abstract and mysterious visuals. It was important for us to provide a 
                    visual environment that takes the user on a journey to an otherwordly space, while keeping them in the present. Animations were selected based on what best symbolizes the current emotion or dominant personality. For example, in the Bubbles world, “fear” makes the bubbles still, while “surprise”  provokes randomly colored spheres.
